# Data Science Course

## Introduction

Many of the world's biggest discoveries and decisions in science, technology, business, medicine, politics, and society as a whole, are now being made on the basis of analyzing data. Professor Widom's short-courses provide an introduction to data science, including some history, case studies, and common pitfalls, along with broad, interactive, hands-on coverage of tools & techniques for data collection, analysis, and visualization.

This short-courses where dictated by Jennifer Widom, Dean of the School of Engineering at Stanford University, from July 19th to July 21st, 2022, at UDLA's campus.

This repository is a collection of all the course materials, including the course notes, presentation slides, and hands-on activities.
